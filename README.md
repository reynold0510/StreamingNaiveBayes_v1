# StreamingNaiveBayes_v1
Streaming Naive Bayes Version 1. In this version, I assume the training data size is large so that training data can not be uploaded into main memory all at the same time. But the testing data size is small, I can load all the testing data into memory. Other memory more efficient algorithms are coming soon.
